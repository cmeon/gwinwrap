==Why is it better than normal wallpaper?==
Xwinwrap allows you to set a screensaver or video as the wallpaper, which can be either painful for your eyes or pleasant, depending on the screensaver settings or the video.

Since xwinwrap is confusing to anyone not familiar with it, Gwinwrap attempts to simplify the process of picking out a screensaver or movie to use, and includes sane defaults that won't kill your eyes.

==When I use gwinwrap, my desktop icons disappear.==
Unfortunately, xwinwrap (and thus gwinwrap) draws above your desktop icons, making them invisible. To fix this, change the opacity to something less than 100% or move your icons to another folder to use. Sorry about this, but it is not something I can fix--I don't code xwinwrap.

==Won't this make my computer slower?==
As long as you use the low cpu priority setting, running xwinwrap through Gwinwrap should not slow down your computer visibly. If you are running folding@home, however, this is not the program for you.

==What if I want to keep my desktop simple?==
If this is the case, you probably won't want to use xwinwrap or gwinwrap.
